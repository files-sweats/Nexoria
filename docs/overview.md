Nexoria is a read-only Base inspector designed to produce consistent outputs for debugging and validation.

Key ideas:
- wallet address discovery is optional and only works in a browser
- chain reads are always performed via RPC
- explorer links are emitted to speed up reviews and manual verification

Use Base Sepolia as a validation environment before relying on Base Mainnet in production tooling.
